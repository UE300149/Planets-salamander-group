The planet is beautiful as observed by astronomers, and can be seen in earth's sky with or without a telescope.

highly reduces visibility
The cloudy atmosphere could make it harder to navigate the lander to the surface, but the earthlike gravity of Venus means that crew will not have to acclimatize as harshly
