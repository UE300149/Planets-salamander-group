The planet is further from the sun than the earth resulting in much colder temperatures that may be unconducive for
potential landers

Jupiter has a the largest number of moons in the solar system, with four large (can be visible from earth using a telescope),
and many smaller ones.The larger moons would be facinating to observe and study further from closer proximity.
