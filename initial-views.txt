Initial views on the planned missions

The idea of exploring new planets is both exhilarating and scary, i.e., Being the first human(s) to set foot on a previously
unexplored planet or making contact with an entirely new species

The mission could be risky for the team sent as some factors regarding the planets' ability to sustain life are unknown or outright 
dangerous

Because of these concerns, the lander should be sent to the planet where chances of success and survivability for the crew are greatest.
